# 🌍 Global Land Temperature Analysis using R  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **global land surface temperatures** using the publicly available dataset from Kaggle: *Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data*.  

The goal is to understand long-term climate trends by exploring and visualizing temperature changes across time and countries.  

## ✨ Key Features  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, date formatting).  
- Visualization of **global average temperature trends** from historical records.  
- Comparison of temperature patterns for selected countries (India, USA, China, Brazil, Germany).  
- Distribution analysis of temperatures across all countries.  
- Boxplots for the **top 10 countries** with the most temperature records.  
- Heatmap visualization of temperature variations across countries and years.  

## 📊 Visual Insights  
- 📈 **Global warming trend**: Clear increase in average land temperature over time.  
- 🌎 **Country-level trends**: Different warming patterns across regions.  
- 📦 **Boxplots**: Show variation and spread in countries with most records.  
- 🔥 **Heatmap**: Highlights temporal and spatial variations in temperature.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **R** (primary language)  
- Libraries:  
  - `readr` → For reading CSV files  
  - `dplyr` → Data cleaning & manipulation  
  - `lubridate` → Date-time processing  
  - `ggplot2` → Data visualization  

## 📂 Dataset  
- Source: [Kaggle – Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data)  
- File used: `GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv`  

## 📌 Results & Findings  

- 🌡️ The **global average temperature** shows a steady upward trend over time, providing strong evidence of global warming.  
- 🌍 Both developing and industrialized countries show **consistent warming patterns**, though the rate and magnitude vary across regions.  
- 📦 **Boxplots** of the top 10 countries reveal significant variation in recorded temperatures, highlighting regional climate differences.  
- 🔥 The **heatmap analysis** shows widespread warming across almost all countries, with the most noticeable increases occurring during the last century.  
- ✅ Overall, the analysis reinforces the global concern of **climate change and rising land surface temperatures**.
